My piano journey started when I was 4 years old. At Zhejiang University, I studied with [Dr. CHEN Lie](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv4925133/).
After coming to UNC Chapel Hill, I have studied with [Dr. Robert Buxton](https://www.robertbuxtonpianist.com) 
and [Dr. Teddy Robie](https://www.teddyrobie.com/index.html).
